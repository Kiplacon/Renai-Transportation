---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.3
Date: 7/4/2020
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed handling of burner inserters with the anti-long-boi-arm-stretch code that would sometimes cause a crash on the current 0.18 versions for some reason
    - Workaround fix for the "no power" icon to appear on throwers not connected to electricity.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.2
Date: 7/3/2020
  Changes:
    - Adjusted bounce effects to appear on top of the bounce pads, in the "higher-object-above" render_layer to be exact. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.1
Date: 7/1/2020
  Additions:
    - New research that allows configuring the range of throwers to be between 1-15. Hover and press Interact to adjust range.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.0
Date: 6/29/2020
  Additions:
    - Directed Bounce Pads. I feel like these really round out the functionality.
    - Hatches. Finally compatability for other things with inventories.
    - Basic tech tree
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.6
Date: 6/12/2020

    - Some compatability issues with the ADAPTIVE thrower generation (icon vs icons, actual vs function, etc)
  Additions:
    - Bounce and Priming sound effects
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.5
Date: 6/12/2020
  Bugfixes:
    - Script detection of bots and etc. that broke when changing over to procedurally generated throwers
    - Compatability with Rusty Locale
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.4
Date: 6/12/2020
  Removed:
    - Version 0.2.3 because I just felt like it whatcha gonna do
    - Hard coded throwers (NOOBS)
  Additions:
    - Procedurally generated throwers for all inserters including ones added by mods. (EPICO) They are unlocked by default for now, research to come.
    - Split Primer Bounce Pad into Precise and Spread varients. Swap by pressing "Interact"
    - Primed land mines. Good with a spread mode Bounce Pad
  Changes:
    - Launch key (default F) renamed to Interact so you can use the same key to swap modes
    - Thrower Inserter slightly slower
    - Throwers only run when at full power to avoid the wacky arm stretching issue when they run at low power.
    - Damage taken from landing on something now scales with the size of the thing you landed on.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.2
Date: 5/26/2020
  Changes:
    - Some file name case correction that I'm not sure was even needed but hey it's worth a shot.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.1
Date: 5/26/2020

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.0
Date: 5/17/2020
  Additions:
    - Added thrower varients of all the different inserter types. They are unlocked with their respective normal version's research.
    - Added range indicators to the Bounce Pads
  Changes:
    - Changed the Player Launcher so that you don't have to hover it with the mouse in order to use it. Now you just have to stand on it and press the launch key.
  Bugfixes:
    - Changed how bounces are calculated so that blueprint ghosts are not longer destroyed when things land on them.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.6
Date: 5/9/2020
  Bugfixes:
    - Improved compatability with other mods that happen to use my same naming convention where a projectile/target based on an item was called the projectile/targets name plus -projectile/-target. Now my projectiles/targets have the suffix -projectile/targetFromRenaiTransportation respectively. Issue pointed out by Drury who noted my mod was incompatible with Krastorio 2.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.5
Date: 5/7/2020
  Bugfixes:
    - Made the same fix in 0.1.4 but applied it to on_configuration_changed too on the off chance that people had the mod installed and kept 0.1.3 while it was still bugged and updated to 0.1.4
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.4
Date: 5/7/2020
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed that the Player Launcher wouldn't work on existing saves because the AllPlayers table wouldn't be set up in those cases. Now fills the table with all players in the save during initialization. Problem source identified by fgcapo.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.3
Date: 5/4/2020
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed script_raised_built listener problem where I copied the code from the on_built_entity listener not realizing the related entity is reffered to as just .entity instead of .created_entity. Problem identified by darkfrei.
    - Preemptive bug fix adding on_entity_cloned listener for built thrower inserters. Recommended by AshenSwift.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.2
Date: 5/3/2020
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed that Thrower Inserters wouldn't work when built by bots by adding on_robot_built_entity and script_raised_built events to listen for. Problem identified by therax.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.1
Date: 4/26/2020
  Changes:
    - Made the Bounce Pad smaller so you can walk between them when they're next to each other.
  Additions:
    - The change log lmao.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed that you could get stuck on a cliff if you launched into it, because apparently it's immune to .die() Now you land at the closest free spot.
