Version: 0.5.3
Date: 9/7/2020
  Bugfixes:
    - Semi-fix preventing players without an associated character from getting on a zipline. This should prevent crashes on a zipline when the character disapears but doesn't cover cases where the controlled character changes or disapears. Found by MPeti1 
    - Fixed that wire connections to things other than power poles (like switches) would crash. Found by MPeti1 
    - Made it so that ramps auto-heal to 99999999999 instead of whatever value it was last hit for in hopes that it prevents some weird cases where the ramps are just vanishing or occasionally left with some damage. Found by Ki-Tan
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.5.2
Date: 9/6/2020
  Changes:
    - Removed some debugging code when clicking on throwers
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed that characters would jump out of a train upon landing due to the change I made so that the jumps would work in sandbox mode
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.5.1
Date: 9/5/2020
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed code analyzing power poles without a copper cable connection. Found by HairyDave
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.5.0
Date: 9/5/2020
  Additions:
    - Electric Zipline Trolley. Use your existing power grid as a highway! See player settings to adjust zipline camera motion.
    - Experimental overflow minimization code. Can be enable in Map Settings. Helps particularly with transport belts, a 3x3 "catching grid" should stop most overflow. 
    - Settings to enable/disable different parts of the mod. Modules include: modded inserter throwers, train ramps, train bounce pads, advanced bounce pads (primer&signal), and zipline. Vanilla throwers, player launchers, hatches, and regular/directed bounce pads are always enabled. Recommended by Zuzak.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed a crash when using a Train Ramp in sandbox mode. The environment was probably too toxic in there. Found by notnotmelon.
    - Fixed a crazy situation where if two trains were trying to land close to each other and one didn't have a destination and thus stopped immediately to 0 speed while another train or wagon with a netagive speed (backwards) tried to attach to it and make the stationary train move with negative speed, the game would crash because I didn't take a 0 speed train into account. Report and initial investigation by mvolfik and ProkopRandacek on github.
    - Made the stand in cars that guided the trains jump invincible so it couldn't be destroyed premptively.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.4.8
Date: 8/28/2020
  Additions:
    - Added an alternate mode for the Train Ramp that does not do the schedule skipping after a jump. Swap between the modes by hovering a ramp and pressing Interact. Requested by many people.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed that flying trains would be affected by belts transport belts underneath.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.4.7
Date: 8/23/2020
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed (I think) a crash related to making thrower varient of an inserter without a minable.result
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.4.6
Date: 8/22/2020
  Additions:
    - Added equipment grids to be carried over after a jump if the train has it. Suggested by MPeti1
  Changes:
    - Adjusted the train jump animation so it looks less jank.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.4.5
Date: 8/19/2020
  Changes:
    - Made it so that trains won't speed up or slow down until either all carriages reconnect, or 4 seconds have passed since it landed. This makes train jumps about 69x more managable to use.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.4.4
Date: 8/18/2020
  Additions:
    - Clicking on any bounce pad toggles it's range indicator visibility in alt-view.
    - Primer Bounce Plate compatability with artillery shells.
  Changes:
    - Changed all bounce pad range indicators again to be the normal yellow/orange.
    - Bounce pad range indicator is now more transparent so hopefully it's not as distracting in alt-view while still being helpful.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed another train crash involving cliffs that I already implemented but it turns out there's another spot in the code I had to integrate the fix lmao
    - Fixed a crash that would happen if there isn't any room to drop an item on the ground after being thrown. It now searched infinitely for a free spot. Discovered by CaptainSlide.
    - Fixed Hatch integration with blueprints/copy/paste by adding that it's a player-creation to its flags.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.4.3
Date: 8/16/2020
  Changes:
    - Specified that trains must hit ramps exactly straight in the ramp description. Recommended by Sparen.
    - Specified thrower range can be adjusted using Interact in their descriptions.
    - Adjusted the bounce pad range image to line up better horizontally
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.4.2
Date: 8/15/2020
  Additions:
    - Bounce Pads show their range in alt-mode instead of on hover
  Changes:
    - Added train ramp to the thumbnail
    - Flying trains now shift slightly to better align with train bounce pads. This helps all carriages in a train travel, fly, and bounce together.
    - Following trains better sync up with the lead train.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed handling of players jumping on Train bounce pads.
    - Fixed thrower bunrner inserters not self refueling when facing down or right
    - Fixed another crash when jumping trains land, explode, and damage surrounding entities which were somehow becoming invalid between being detected and being dealt damage
    - Fixed Spread Primer Bounce Pad integration with blueprints/copy/paste by adding placeable_by to its prototype
    - Added raise_built=true when recreating launched trains for better modded train compatability 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    - Shadows for all the Bounce Pads
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed ordering of final-fixes code so that projectiles for generated thrower are actually created
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.7
Date: 7/18/2020
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed scaling for the particle of thrown items so that icons of different sizes graphically should all show in game at roughly the same size
    - Remved the need for the placeholder image for items with layered icons
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.6
Date: 7/17/2020

    - Fixed compatability with the new capsule action code in Factorio 0.18.36
    - Fixed primer bounce pad compatability with moded land mines
    - Fixed migration from saves that never had the hard coded thrower varients probably
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.5
Date: 7/4/2020
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed compatability issues with other mods that added capsules with non-conventional functions. Namely, Tapeline and Vehicle Wagon 2 were tested. Reported by saaadel

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.2
Date: 7/3/2020

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.1
Date: 7/1/2020
  Additions:
    - New research that allows configuring the range of throwers to be between 1-15. Hover and press Interact to adjust range.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.0
Date: 6/29/2020
  Additions:
    - Directed Bounce Pads. I feel like these really round out the functionality.
    - Hatches. Finally compatability for other things with inventories.
    - Basic tech tree
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.6
Date: 6/12/2020

Date: 6/12/2020
  Removed:
    - Version 0.2.3 because I just felt like it whatcha gonna do
    - Hard coded throwers (NOOBS)
  Additions:
    - Procedurally generated throwers for all inserters including ones added by mods. (EPICO) They are unlocked by default for now, research to come.
    - Split Primer Bounce Pad into Precise and Spread varients. Swap by pressing "Interact"
    - Primed land mines. Good with a spread mode Bounce Pad
  Changes:
    - Launch key (default F) renamed to Interact so you can use the same key to swap modes
    - Thrower Inserter slightly slower
    - Throwers only run when at full power to avoid the wacky arm stretching issue when they run at low power.
    - Damage taken from landing on something now scales with the size of the thing you landed on.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.2
Date: 5/26/2020
  Changes:
    - Some file name case correction that I'm not sure was even needed but hey it's worth a shot.

    - Changed how bounces are calculated so that blueprint ghosts are not longer destroyed when things land on them.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.6
Date: 5/9/2020
  Bugfixes:
    - Improved compatability with other mods that happen to use my same naming convention where a projectile/target based on an item was called the projectile/targets name plus -projectile/-target. Now my projectiles/targets have the suffix -projectile/targetFromRenaiTransportation respectively. Issue pointed out by Drury who noted my mod was incompatible with Krastorio 2.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.5
Date: 5/7/2020
  Bugfixes:
    - Made the same fix in 0.1.4 but applied it to on_configuration_changed too on the off chance that people had the mod installed and kept 0.1.3 while it was still bugged and updated to 0.1.4
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.4
Date: 5/7/2020
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed that the Player Launcher wouldn't work on existing saves because the AllPlayers table wouldn't be set up in those cases. Now fills the table with all players in the save during initialization. Problem source identified by fgcapo.

Date: 5/4/2020
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed script_raised_built listener problem where I copied the code from the on_built_entity listener not realizing the related entity is reffered to as just .entity instead of .created_entity. Problem identified by darkfrei.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.2
Date: 5/3/2020
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed that Thrower Inserters wouldn't work when built by bots by adding on_robot_built_entity and script_raised_built events to listen for. Problem identified by therax.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.1
Date: 4/26/2020
  Changes:
    - Made the Bounce Pad smaller so you can walk between them when they're next to each other.
  Additions:
    - The change log lmao.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed that you could get stuck on a cliff if you launched into it, because apparently it's immune to .die() Now you land at the closest free spot.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
