BouncePlate=Items or players thrown onto the Bounce Pad will bounce forward another 10 tiles. Works in all 4 directions. Click to toggle range visibility in alt-view.
PrimerBouncePlate=Grenades, capsules, land mines, rockets, shells, and other items will be primed to activate after bouncing on this. The extra power increases the range to 40 tiles. Non-primable things only bounce 10 tiles.\nPress "Interact" (default F) to switch to Spread Mode. Click to toggle range visibility in alt-view.
PrimerSpreadBouncePlate=Grenades, capsules, land mines, rockets, shells, and other items will be primed to activate after bouncing on this. The extra power increases the range to 37-40 tiles with a 40 tile spread. Non-primable things only bounce 10 tiles.\nPress "Interact" (default F) to switch to Precise Mode. Click to toggle range visibility in alt-view.
SignalBouncePlate=Acts like a Constant Combinator. The signal turns on/off when items or players bounce on it. Click to toggle range visibility in alt-view.
DirectedBouncePlate=Like a regular Bounce Pad but directed. Click to toggle range visibility in alt-view..

OpenContainer=An Iron Chest without its lid so items can fall into it.

PlayerLauncher=Stand on top and press the Interact key (default F) to propell yourself forward 10 tiles. Land on a bounce pad to jump even farther.

HatchRT=Install a Hatch onto things with an inventory to allow thrown items to fall into them.

RTTrainRamp=A train launching off this ramp has the "current destination" on its schedule bumped forward by one stop. This allows guiding automatic trains to the ramp you want it to take using a Train Stop placed after the ramp without messing up the intended route. Press Interact to toggle this schedule skipping off when it is not needed.\nKeep in mind the train might slow down if it approaches a stop, or if the next stop after the jump isn't readily accessible. The train's speed when it hits the ramp dictates how far it will fly. Trains must hit the ramp exactly straight.
RTTrainRampNoSkip=A train launching off this ramp does NOT affect the "current destination" on its schedule. Press Interact to swap back skipping mode.\nKeep in mind the train might slow down if it approaches a stop, or if the next stop after the jump isn't readily accessible. The train's speed when it hits the ramp dictates how far it will fly. Trains must hit the ramp exactly straight.
RTTrainBouncePlate=Trains landing on these up-scaled Bounce Pads will bounce forward again. Still kinda finicky, mostly just added for the memes.
RTTrainDirectedBouncePlate=Like a regular Directed Bounce Pad, but for trains. Still kinda finicky, mostly just added for the memes.

RTFocusedFlinging=Allows you to adjust a thrower's throwing distance to be less than 15. Hover and press Interact (default F) to do so.
RTFlyingFreight=Train junctions? More like train jump-tions ,':)
RTFreightPlates=It's like bounce pads, but for trains.

[item-description]
RTZiplineItem=This motorized zipline trolley runs off the electricity flowing through the cable it rides on. Equip this with a controller, select it, and press Interact on a power pole to start riding, and Interact again to jump off. Automatically dismounts at dead ends.\nConsumes 450kW of power.
RTZiplineControlsItem=Equip a pair of these in the ammo slot of the Electric Zipline Trolley to control its movement.

[mod-setting-description]
RTZiplineSmoothSetting=Whether camera motion on the zipline should follow the curve of the wire, or stay level.
RTModdedThrowers=Enables thrower varients of modded inserters, otherwise only vanilla inserter throwers are made.
RTOverflowComp=Toggles on or off the logic that helps minimize overflow from throwers spilling items all over the place. Disabling probably saves UPS
