BouncePlate=Items or players thrown onto the Bounce Pad will bounce forward another 10 tiles. Works in all 4 directions.
PrimerBouncePlate=Grenades, capsules, land mines, and other items will be primed to activate after bouncing on this. The extra power increases the range to 40 tiles. Non-primable things only bounce 10 tiles.\nPress "Interact" (default F) to switch to Spread Mode.
PrimerSpreadBouncePlate=Grenades, capsules, land mines, and other items will be primed to activate after bouncing on this. The extra power increases the range to 37-40 tiles with a 40 tile spread. Non-primable things only bounce 10 tiles.\nPress "Interact" (default F) to switch to Precise Mode.
SignalBouncePlate=Acts like a Constant Combinator. The signal turns on/off when items or players bounce on it.
DirectedBouncePlate=Like a regular Bounce Pad but directed. Circuit network direction control to be implemented one day.

OpenContainer=An Iron Chest without its lid so items can fall into it.

PlayerLauncher=Stand on top and press the Interact key (default F) to propell yourself forward 10 tiles. Land on a bounce pad to jump even farther.

HatchRT=Install a Hatch onto things with an inventory to allow thrown items to fall into them.

RTTrainRamp=Flying train go brrrrr. When a train launches off a ramp, its "next stop" on its schedule is bumped forward by one stop, so it is recommended to guide automatic trains to the ramp you want it to take using a Train Stop placed after the ramp. Keep in mind the train might slow down if it approaches a stop, or if the next stop after the jump isn't readily accessible. The train's speed when it hits the ramp dictates how far it will fly. A train with many carriages might also lose a few carts during a jump if it is going too fast or too slow for how much weight it is pulling. Trains must hit the ramp exactly straight.
RTTrainBouncePlate=Trains landing on these up-scaled Bounce Pads will bounce forward again. Still kinda finicky, mostly just added for the memes.
RTTrainDirectedBouncePlate=Like a regular Directed Bounce Pad, but for trains. Still kinda finicky, mostly just added for the memes.

HatchRTTech=Hatches allow thrown items to fall into other things besides just open chests.
RTThrowerTime=Thrower versions of all inserters currently installed, even modded ones.
SignalPlateTech=Thrower and Circuit Network crossover
PrimerPlateTech=Ever wish you could throw your grenades and rockets even further?
RTFocusedFlinging=Allows you to adjust a thrower's throwing distance to be less than 15. Hover and press Interact (default F) to do so.
RTFlyingFreight=Train junctions? More like train jump-tions ,':)
RTFreightPlates=It's like bounce pads, but for trains.
